## About Dropshare

Dropshare is a versatile productivity application that simplifies the process of sharing files and screenshots. It combines a powerful screenshot tool with a flexible file uploader, allowing you to capture, annotate, and share visual content or upload any other file type with minimal effort. The key to Dropshare is its ability to work with your own infrastructure—you can configure it to upload to your personal server via SFTP/SCP, or to various cloud services like Amazon S3, Google Drive, or Dropbox. This gives you full control over your data and privacy, unlike many public sharing services.

The application excels in streamlining workflows. After an upload, it automatically copies a short URL to your clipboard, ready to paste into a chat, email, or document. The screenshot module is feature-rich, offering options like timer delays, cursor capture, and a robust editor for adding arrows, text, and blur effects before sharing. By living in your menu bar, Dropshare is always one click away, making it the perfect tool for developers sharing logs, designers sharing mockups, support teams documenting issues, or anyone who needs to share information quickly and efficiently.
